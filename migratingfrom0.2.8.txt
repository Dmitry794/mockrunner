Starting with version 0.2.9, Mockrunner supports the MockEJB 0.6 API
and the new features of MockEJB. This breaks the Mockrunner API in a
few cases.

If you don't use the EJBTestModule and do not test JMS code with
message driven beans, everything should be fine.

Otherwise, please consider the following changes:

- MockEJB 0.6 deprecates the use of MockEjbObject in favor of the new
  interceptor framework. The MockContainer.deploy methods no longer
  return the MockEjbObject. For this reason, EJBTestModule.deploy
  methods do not return this object as well. Please refer to
  the MockEJB documentation on http://www.mockejb.org
  
- MockEJB 0.6 supports session beans, entity beans and message driven
  beans and provides a descriptor for each of these bean types.
  You can deploy each bean type using the EJBTestModule API. There
  is a generic deploy method and special deploySessionBean, deployEntityBean
  and deployMessageBean methods. The deploy method for session beans was
  renamed to deploySessionBean. If you use this method, you have to change
  the name. However, parameters are the same.
  
- Major changes affect message driven beans. If you use the Mockrunner JMS
  test framework without message driven beans, you should not be affected
  by the changes.
