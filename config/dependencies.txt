This file lists all the jar files provided by Mockrunner and
the required third party libraris for each jar. Please note
that this file is created automatically by analyzing the
compile time dependencies of all classes in the jar. This
is done recursively, i.e. the dependencies of the third-party
jars are recognized as well. If you add all dependend jars
for a specified mockrunner-xyz.jar to your classpath, you
are on the safe side. However, not all listed dependencies
are necessary in all cases. Especially with the "all-in-one"-files
mockrunner.jar and mockrunner-jdk1.3.jar, you don't have to
add everything to the classpath. E.g. if you're only using EJB
and JMS, you don't have to add the web related jar files, because
the necessary factories and modules are created when they are used
resp. lazy initialized.
Please note that each mockrunner-xyz.jar file contains a jarversion.txt 
which lists the Mockrunner version and the supported JDK and J2EE versions.
