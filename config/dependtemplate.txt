This file lists all the jar files provided by Mockrunner and
the required third party libraris for each jar. Please note
that this file is created automatically by analyzing the
compile time dependencies of all classes in the jar. This
is done recursively, i.e. the dependencies of the third-party
jars are recognized as well. If you add all dependend jars
for a specified mockrunner-xyz.jar to your classpath, you
are on the safe side. However, not all listed dependencies
are necessary at runtime in all cases. Especially with the 
"all-in-one"-files mockrunner.jar, mockrunner-jdk1.3.jar,
mockrunner-j2ee1.3.jar and mockrunner-jdk1.3-j2ee1.3.jar
you don't have to add everything to the classpath. E.g. if you're 
only using EJB and JMS, you don't have to add the web related jar 
files, because the necessary factories and modules are created when 
they are used resp. lazy initialized. Please note that the Struts
test framework only needs CGLib, if custom action mappings are used.
If you only need one technology it's recommended to use the corresponding
jar file instead of the "all-in-one" mockrunner.jar. E.g. if you only want
to use the JDBC test framework, you can use mockrunner-jdbc.jar.
Please note that each mockrunner-xyz.jar file contains a jarversion.txt 
which lists the Mockrunner version and the supported JDK and J2EE versions.
