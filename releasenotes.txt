mockrunner-0.2.5:

mockrunner-0.2.1:

- fixed bugs 823527, 835062 and 836259
- removed deprecated methods and classes.
- removed dependencies from www.mockobjects.com mock objects,
  the mockobjects jars are no longer necessary.
- introduced EJBMockObjectFactory which performs all
  the MockUserTransaction handling. Removed the getMockUserTransaction
  method from JDBCMockObjectFactory. MockUserTransaction is in
  com.mockrunner.mock.ejb package now.

mockrunner-0.2:

- reorganized package structure for mockobjects. The
  mockobjects of mockrunner-0.1.5 are in com.mockrunner.mock.web
  package now. Please adapt your imports.
- renamed MockObjectFactory to WebMockObjectFactory and moved
  it to com.mockrunner.mock.web package, renamed the corresponding
  createMockObjectFactory methods to createWebMockObjectFactory.
  There's also a JDBCMockObjectFactory now in com.mockrunner.mock.jdbc
  package and corresponding createJDBCMockObjectFactory methods.
  The old MockObjectFactory is deprecated and will be removed in
  the next release.
- first version of the JDBC test framework.
- added mockejb.jar in order to test EJBs in conjunction with
  the test modules of Mockrunner. Have a look at 
  http://mockejb.sourceforge.net.

  custom request wrappers. This makes it possible to
  use filters in conjunction with Struts actions
  (among other things)
- added addRequestParameter() methods to ServletTestModule and
  ServletTestCaseAdapter
- replaced JDK 1.3 mockobjects with JDK 1.4 version
- Mockrunner provides two jar files for JDK 1.3 and JDK 1.4

  include this in the classpath even if you only use the test modules 
  that are not Struts related (e.g ServletTestModule or JDBCTestModule)

- reorganized package structure. ActionTestModule and
  ActionTestCaseAdapter are in com.mockrunner.struts
  package now. The tag stuff is in the com.mockrunner.tag

  is able to perform the tag lifecycle as in the real
  container.
