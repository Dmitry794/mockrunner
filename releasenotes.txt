mockrunner-0.2:

- reorganized package structure for mockobjects. The
  mockobjects of mockrunner-0.1.5 are in com.mockrunner.mock.web
  package now. Please adapt your imports.
- renamed MockObjectFactory to WebMockObjectFactory and moved
  it to com.mockrunner.mock.web package, renamed the corresponding
  createMockObjectFactory methods to createWebMockObjectFactory.
  There's also a JDBCMockObjectFactory now in com.mockrunner.mock.jdbc
  package and corresponding createJDBCMockObjectFactory methods.
- first version of the JDBC test framework.
- added mockejb.jar in order to test EJBs in conjunction with
  the test modules of Mockrunner. Have a look at 
  http://mockejb.sourceforge.net.
- added methods to WebMockObjectFactory in order to specify
  custom request wrappers. This makes it possible to
  use filters in conjunction with Struts actions
  (among other things)
- added addRequestParameter() methods to ServletTestModule and
  ServletTestCaseAdapter
- replaced JDK 1.3 mockobjects with 1.4 version
- added some jars from Jakarta Commons

- updated servlet.jar from Tomcat 4.1.18 to 4.1.27

  include this in the classpath even if you only use the test modules 
  that are not Struts related (e.g ServletTestModule or JDBCTestModule)

mockrunner-0.1.5:

- reorganized package structure. ActionTestModule and
  ActionTestCaseAdapter are in com.mockrunner.struts
  package now. The tag stuff is in the com.mockrunner.tag
  package. Please adapt your imports.
- improved the TagTestModule. It supports nested tag and
  is able to perform the tag lifecycle as in the real
  container.
- added ServletTestModule with servlet and filter support
- implemented parsing of HTML output
- added some useful methods to ActionTestModule
- added third party jars to release (except for the big
  Xerces and Struts jars)
